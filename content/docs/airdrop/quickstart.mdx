## Local Development Setup

For easier development you can run your Airdrop snap-in locally and receive logs directly in your console.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [DevRev CLI](https://developer.devrev.ai/snapin-development/references/cli-install) (version 4.7 or higher)
- [chef-cli](https://github.com/devrev/adaas-chef-cli)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (version 18.x.x or higher)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

### Running the Template

DevRev offers a starter Airdrop snap-in template that is ready for immediate use and testing.

<Steps>

### 1. Create a new repository

Create a new repository from this template by clicking the "Use this template" button in the upper right corner and then "Create a new repository". The repository name must start with `airdrop-` (for example, `airdrop-asana-snap-in`).

### 2. Authenticate to DevRev

Open the project in your IDE and authenticate to your DevRev organization using the DevRev CLI:

```bash
devrev profiles authenticate --org <your DevRev organization slug>
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Install the snap-in dependencies from the `code` directory:

```bash
cd code
npm ci
```

### 4. Start the development server

Start the snap-in development server from the `code` directory:

```bash
npm run test:server -- local
```

This will start the snap-in server on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 5. Start ngrok

Start the ngrok tunnel in a separate terminal window:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

This will create a tunnel to your local server. The ngrok forwarding URL will be displayed in the terminal window.

### 6. Create snap-in version

Copy the ngrok forwarding URL and create a new snap-in version and snap-in package using the DevRev CLI:

```bash
devrev snap_in_version create-one --manifest ./manifest.yaml --create-package --testing-url <ngrok forwarding URL>
```
*Note: Run this command from the root of the project directory.*

### 7. Create a snap-in draft

Create a snap-in draft using the DevRev CLI:

```bash
devrev snap_in draft
```

### 8. Install the snap-in

After the snap-in draft is created, install the snap-in:

```bash
devrev snap_in activate
```
</Steps>

## Performing an Initial Sync

Now that you have a running snap-in, you can start an import. Go to the DevRev app and click **Airdrops** -> **Start Airdrop** -> **Your snap-in**. The initial sync process involves several steps, from establishing a connection to the external system to mapping data and finally saving it to DevRev. For a more detailed walkthrough of this process, see the "Your First Airdrop" guide.
