## Core Airdrop Concepts

Before starting snap-in development, it's important to understand these fundamental terms and concepts.

### Sync Unit

A **sync unit** is one self-encompassing unit of data that is synced to an external system. For example:
- A project in Jira.
- An account in SalesForce.
- An organization in Zendesk.

In Jira, users often have multiple projects, and each project acts as an individual sync unit. In contrast, Zendesk operates with a single large pool of tickets and agents. Here, the entire Zendesk instance can be treated as a single sync unit.

### Sync Run

Airdrop extractions are done in **sync runs**. A sync run is one end-to-end (extract-transform-load) execution of a sync unit. Each time you import data from the external system to DevRev, or export data from DevRev to the external system, you are performing a sync run.

Each sync run is comprised of sequential **phases**, and each phase can consist of one or more invocations of the snap-in.

## Sync Directions and Types

### Forward Sync (1-way)

A **forward sync** is a sync run from an external system *to* DevRev. An **extractor** function in the snap-in is responsible for extracting data from the external system. This is also known as a 1-way sync.

#### Initial Sync

The first forward sync is called the **initial sync**. It is triggered manually by the end user in the DevRev **Airdrops** UI. During the initial sync, all data from the chosen sync unit is extracted from the external system and loaded into DevRev. This process typically involves a large import and may take some time.

An initial import consists of the following phases:
1.  External sync units extraction
2.  Metadata extraction
3.  Data extraction
4.  Attachments extraction

#### Incremental Sync

An **incremental sync** refers to any forward sync after the initial sync has been successfully completed. An extractor extracts data that was created or updated in the external system since the start of the last successful forward sync.

An incremental sync consists of the following phases:
1.  Metadata extraction
2.  Data extraction
3.  Attachments extraction

### Reverse Sync (2-way)

A **reverse sync** is a sync run from DevRev *to* an external system. It uses a **loader** function to create or update data in the external system. This is also known as a 2-way sync.

A reverse sync consists of the following phases:
1.  Data loading
2.  Attachments loading

### Time-Scoped Sync

Normally, an initial sync extracts all data from an organization, and an incremental sync only extracts changes since the last successful sync. A **time-scoped sync**, on the other hand, allows for the extraction of data beginning from a custom timestamp.

This approach is useful for initially testing the integration with a smaller data set—such as data from the last month—before conducting a full import of all available data.
