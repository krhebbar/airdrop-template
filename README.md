# ADaaS Template

This GitHub repository provides a template with example code to implement an Airdrop as a Service (ADaaS) Snap-in.

## Prerequisites

1\. Install [DevRev CLI](https://developer.devrev.ai/snapin-development/references/cli-install) by following the instructions as per the Operating System.

2\. Install [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/).

3\. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

4\. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).

## Getting Started

1\. Create a new repository:

- Create a new repository from this template by clicking the "Use this template" button in the upper right corner and then "Create a new repository".
- The repository name must start with `airdrop-` (e.g., `airdrop-<external system>-snap-in`).

2\. Open the project in your IDE and authenticate to your DevRev organization using the DevRev CLI:

```bash
devrev profiles authenticate --org <your DevRev Organization slug>
```

3\. Install the Snap-in dependencies from the `code` directory:

```bash
npm ci
```

4\. Start the Snap-in development server from the `code` directory:

```bash
npm run test:server -- local
```

This will start the Snap-in server on `http://localhost:8000`.

5\. Start the ngrok tunnel in a separate terminal window:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

This will create a tunnel to your local server. The ngrok forwarding URL will be displayed in the terminal window.

6\. Copy the ngrok forwarding URL and create a new Snap-in version and Snap-in package using the DevRev CLI:

```bash
devrev snap_in_version create-one  --manifest ./manifest.yaml --create-package --testing-url <ngrok forwarding URL>
```

7\. Create a Snap-in draft using the DevRev CLI:

```bash
devrev snap_in draft
```

8\. After the Snap-in draft is created, install the Snap-in in the DevRev UI (`Settings` -> `Snap-ins` -> `Installed` -> `<your Snap-in>` -> `Install snap-in`) or using the DevRev CLI:

```bash
devrev snap_in activate
```

9\. Start the import (`Airdrops` -> `Start Airdrop` -> `<your Snap-in>`).

## Build, Deploy and Run

1\. Open the project in your IDE and set up project environment variables, by following these steps:

- Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
- In `.env` set the slug of your organization, and your email.

2\. Build the Snap-in using the following command:

```bash
make build
```

3\. Deploy the Snap-in to the organization:

```bash
make deploy
```

NOTE: This process may take some time. Command authenticates you to the org using the DevRev CLI, creates a Snap-in package, its Snap-in version, and finally the Snap-in draft.

4\. After the Snap-in draft is created, install the Snap-in in the DevRev UI (`Settings` -> `Snap-ins` -> `Installed` -> `<your Snap-in>` -> `Install snap-in`) or using the DevRev CLI:

```bash
devrev snap_in activate
```

5\. Start the import (`Airdrops` -> `Start Airdrop` -> `<your Snap-in>`).

## Common Pitfalls

- `Conflict` error after the `Creating snap-in package...` output during `make deploy`.

  - Snap-in package with the same slug already exists. Override the `SNAP_IN_SLUG` variable by explicitly updating the variable in `scripts/vars.sh`.

- Snap-in version `build/deployment failed` after the `Waiting for snap-in version to be ready...` message

  - The snap-in version could not be built. Check the logs by running the DevRev CLI command `devrev snap_in_package logs`. For prettier UI, pipe the output to `jq`

- `Token is expired` when deploying or cleaning up.

  - Authentication token to the `DEV_ORG` has expired. Run `make auth` to reconnect to the organization.
