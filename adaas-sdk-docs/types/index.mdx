# Types Module

The `types` module consolidates all the common type definitions, interfaces, and enums used throughout the SDK. It re-exports types from various modules, providing a single point of access for all data structures.

This module exports types related to:
- **Common**: General-purpose types like error records and log records.
- **Extraction**: Types used in the data extraction process.
- **Loading**: Types used in the data loading process.
- **Repo**: Types related to the data repository.
- **State**: Types for state management.
- **Uploader**: Types for the artifact uploader.
- **Workers**: Types for worker threads.
