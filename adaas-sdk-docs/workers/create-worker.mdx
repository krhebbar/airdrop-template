## Grounding

- **Source File:** `src/workers/create-worker.ts`

## Function: `createWorker`

This function creates a new Node.js `Worker` instance. It is an asynchronous function that returns a `Promise` that resolves with the `Worker` object once it is online.

### Signature

async function createWorker<ConnectorState>(
  workerData: WorkerData<ConnectorState>
): Promise<Worker>
```

### Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    workerData: {
      type: 'WorkerData<ConnectorState>',
      description: 'The data to be passed to the worker thread.',
    },
  }}
/>

### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves with the `Worker` instance.

### Error Conditions

This function will reject the `Promise` if:
- It is not called from the main thread.
- An error occurs while the worker is starting up.
