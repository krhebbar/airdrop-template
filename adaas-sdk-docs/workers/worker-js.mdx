# Worker Entry Point (`worker.js`)

This file is the internal entry point for all worker threads created by the SDK.

<Callout type="warning" title="Internal Use Only">
  This file is part of the SDK's internal implementation and should not be modified or called directly.
</Callout>

## Grounding

- **Source File:** `src/workers/worker.js`

---

## Purpose

The `worker.js` file serves as a bridge to allow the SDK to run worker files written in TypeScript. When a new worker thread is created using the `createWorker` function, this `worker.js` file is the script that is actually executed.

It performs two main tasks:
1.  **Registers `ts-node`:** It programmatically registers `ts-node`, which enables Node.js to execute TypeScript code on the fly without a separate compilation step.
2.  **Requires the User's Worker File:** It uses the `workerData` object (which is passed when the worker is created) to get the path to the actual TypeScript worker file (`workerData.workerPath`) and then `require`s it, which starts the execution of the user-provided worker logic.
