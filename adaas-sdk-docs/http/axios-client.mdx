# Axios Client

This page documents the pre-configured Axios client, which is the recommended way to make HTTP requests in the SDK.

## Grounding

- **Source File:** `src/http/axios-client.ts`

---

## `axiosClient`

An `axios` instance that is pre-configured with a robust retry mechanism using `axios-retry`. This client should be used for all external HTTP requests to ensure reliability.

### Features

- **Automatic Retries:** The client will automatically retry failed requests up to 5 times.
- **Exponential Backoff:** An exponential backoff delay is applied between retries to avoid overwhelming the server.
- **Retry Conditions:** Retries are triggered for:
  - Network errors (e.g., no response received).
  - Idempotent requests (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT).
  - All 5xx server errors.
- **Security:** Sensitive headers like `Authorization` are removed from error logs when the maximum number of retries is exceeded.

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { axiosClient } from './axios-client';

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await axiosClient.get('https://api.devrev.ai/v1/some-endpoint');
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error);
  }
}
```

---

## `axios`

The original, unmodified `axios` instance is also exported. This can be used for cases where you need to create a custom Axios instance with different configurations.

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { axios } from './axios-client';

const customClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 5000,
});
```
