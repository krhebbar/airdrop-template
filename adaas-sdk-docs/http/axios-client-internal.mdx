# Internal Axios Client

This page documents the internal Axios client, which is used for communication between different parts of the SDK and the DevRev platform.

<Callout type="warning" title="Internal Use Only">
  This client is intended for internal use within the SDK. For most use cases, you should use the public `axiosClient` documented in the [Axios Client](./axios-client) page.
</Callout>

## Grounding

## `axiosClient` (internal)

An `axios` instance that is pre-configured with a specific retry mechanism for internal API calls.

### Features

- **Automatic Retries:** The client will automatically retry failed requests up to 5 times.
- **Custom Retry Delay:**
    - **For 429 "Too Many Requests" errors:** The client respects the `Retry-After` header returned by the API and waits for the specified duration before retrying.
    - **For other retryable errors:** An exponential backoff delay is applied.
- **Retry Conditions:** Retries are triggered for:
    - 5xx server errors.
    - 429 "Too Many Requests" errors, but only if a valid `Retry-After` header is present.
- **Security:** Sensitive headers like `Authorization` are removed from error logs when the maximum number of retries is exceeded.

### Usage

This client is used internally by the SDK for operations like emitting events. It is not recommended for direct use in snap-in code unless you have a specific need for its retry behavior.
